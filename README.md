I apologise for the absolute mess of a project submitted. I am geniunely embarrassed to submit this.
Everything broke on me when I deployed to Heroku and in trying to fix it I just broke it more and more.
I even managed to loose the readme file info I had filled in by messing up everything so badly I couldn't go a successful pull request.

Sorry!
